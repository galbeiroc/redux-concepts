# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JS apps

* Redux stores the state of your applications
* State of an app is represented by all the individual component of that app
* In Redux the changes to your application's state become predictable
* In Redux, all state transitions are explicit and it is possible to keep track of them
Ex: Todo list app - item (pending) -> item (completed)
